# This workflow uses a `deno` binary along with `eslint` for code linting, and (optional) testing.
# If your tests *don't* require pkgs or non-repo files from your docker build image,
# then you can use this nicely for testing files in your repo like 'test/something.test.js'
# along with a full code coverage report.
